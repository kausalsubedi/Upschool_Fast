                    That is entirely up to you. You may consider making a
                    donation per student that participated or a set donation for
                    the year. Whether it’s big or small, we appreciate it.

            <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
                If we want to change the world, we have to collaborate with
                organisations that have the knowledge, ability, and drive to
                take the necessary actions. We have collaborated with charities
                to raise awareness of the issues they are trying to resolve, and
                to provide a pathway for people to support these organisations.
                Upschool supports these charities but receives no benefit
                (financial or otherwise) for doing so.
