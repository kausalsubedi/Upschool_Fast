                                    learn and play on the lands of the
                                    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
                                    people’s – who are the oldest continuing
                                    culture in human history and the traditional
                                    owners of the land we now call Australia. We
                                    acknowledge the wisdom and diversity of
                                    these people and seek to learn from and be
                                    inspired by their culture. We are grateful

                                    to share this land with them. Our pledge is
                                    to continue to work to bring more awareness
                                    to topics that the elders past, present and
                                    emerging bring our attention to and take

                                    here in Australia and the wider world. We

                                    cultures across the globe and pledge to do
                                    our part to bring fairness, justice and a
